# A Robust, Mathematically Rigorous Framework for Sequence Rule Generation and Evaluation

## Abstract

We introduce a comprehensive framework for the automated generation, parsing, and evaluation of sequence rules via a formally defined domain-specific language (DSL). By leveraging formal semantics, well-defined complexity metrics, canonical normalization, and automata-based evaluation, our system guarantees mathematical rigor and practical performance. We detail our system architecture, algorithmic processes, error handling strategies, integration interfaces, and an experimental roadmap, alongside a plan for formal verification using proof assistants.

## 1. Introduction

Sequence rules underpin numerous applications—from game mechanics to pattern recognition. This framework automatically generates rules from object properties while ensuring they are expressive, bounded by complexity, and environment-aware. Our contributions include:
- A formally defined DSL with clear denotational and operational semantics.
- A rule generator that uses complexity metrics to enforce constraints.
- A robust parser with comprehensive error recovery.
- An equivalence evaluator using canonical normalization and automata conversion.
- A runtime sequence/position evaluator for immediate feedback.

We provide both the theoretical foundations and practical integration strategies necessary for a solid, deployable product.

## 2. Preliminaries and Problem Definition

Let
\[
O = \{ o_1, o_2, \dots, o_n \}
\]
denote a finite set of objects, where each object \( o_i \) possesses properties \( \mathcal{P}(o_i) = \{p_1, p_2, \dots, p_k\} \). A **sequence rule** is a logical predicate dictating valid orderings of these objects. Two key constraints govern rule generation:

- **Complexity Constraint:** Each rule has an associated complexity \( C(\text{rule}) \) measured by a weighted sum, constrained by \( C_{\max} \).
- **Information Constraint:** Rules must reference object properties in a manner proportional to the available information from \( O \).

Our objective is to build a system that rigorously generates, parses, and evaluates these rules.

## 3. Formal DSL Specification

### 3.1. Lexical Elements and Tokens

Define the token set \( \Sigma \):
- **Identifiers:** e.g., property names (e.g., `rank`, `suit`).
- **Constants:** Numeric, Boolean, or string literals.
- **Operators:** \( \{=, \neq, <, >, \le, \ge\} \).
- **Logical Connectives:** \( \{\land, \lor, \lnot\} \).
- **Sequence Operator:** The arrow `->` denotes order.
- **Keywords:** `if`, `then`, `else`.

### 3.2. Grammar in BNF

A concise BNF for our DSL:
```
<Rule>        ::= <Sequence> 
                | "if" <Condition> "then" <Sequence> [ "else" <Sequence> ]
<Sequence>    ::= <Element> ( "->" <Element> )+
<Element>     ::= <Identifier> [ "(" <Condition> ")" ]
<Condition>   ::= <Expression> ( ("and" | "or") <Expression> )*
<Expression>  ::= <Identifier> <RelOp> <Value>
<RelOp>       ::= "=" | "!=" | "<" | ">" | "<=" | ">="
<Identifier>  ::= [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*
<Value>       ::= <Numeric> | <Boolean> | <String>
```

### 3.3. Formal Semantics with Example

We define a semantic mapping:
\[
\llbracket \cdot \rrbracket : \text{Rule} \to \{ \text{true}, \text{false} \}
\]
For example, consider the DSL rule:
```
if rank = 7 then heart -> spade
```
Its semantics is defined as:
\[
\llbracket \texttt{if rank = 7 then heart -> spade} \rrbracket(S) =
\begin{cases}
\text{true}, & \text{if } S \text{ begins with a heart followed by a spade when } \texttt{rank} = 7, \\
\text{false}, & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
\]

## 7. Formal Verification Roadmap

- **Goals:** Mechanically verify core properties such as parser soundness, rule equivalence, and adherence to complexity constraints.
- **Approach:** 
  1. Formalize the DSL grammar and semantics in Coq/Lean.
  2. Prove the correctness of AST-to-FSM conversion and normalization procedures.
  3. Validate that the complexity metric is monotonic and compositional.
- **Milestones:** 
  - Prototype formalization of the DSL.
  - Verification of key algorithms.
  - Integration of verified components into the full system.
- **Outcome:** A trusted core with mathematically proven correctness guarantees.

## 8. Related Work

Our approach integrates and extends established techniques:
- **DSL Design:** Similar methodologies in game rule DSLs (e.g., Ludi) have informed our grammar design.
- **Automata Theory:** Existing literature on FSM minimization and equivalence (e.g., Hopcroft’s algorithm) underpins our evaluation strategy.
- **Formal Verification:** Previous work using Coq/Lean in verifying compiler correctness provides a blueprint for our verification roadmap.

## 9. Conclusion and Future Work

We have presented a robust, mathematically rigorous framework for sequence rule generation and evaluation. By combining formal DSL semantics, constraint-based rule generation, a resilient parser, and automata-based evaluation, our system is both theoretically sound and practically applicable. Future work includes:
- Embedding formal verification into the development pipeline.
- Extending the DSL to accommodate probabilistic and non-deterministic rules.
- Deploying the framework within real-world systems such as interactive game engines.
- Expanding empirical validation with comprehensive benchmarks.

This integrated approach positions our framework as a solid, extensible product ready to meet complex real-world demands.

1. Core Tech Stack (Python + Logic Language)
Python (General Infrastructure)
Why? Python offers ease of use, rich libraries for parsing, automata, and constraint-solving.
Key Libraries:
ANTLR4 (for DSL Parsing) – Define the grammar and generate an AST.
SymPy (for Rule Normalization) – Symbolic computation for rule equivalence.
NetworkX (for Automata) – Construct and manipulate finite-state machines.
Z3 (for Logic & Constraint Solving) – Useful for checking rule consistency.
scikit-learn (for Heuristics, if needed) – Used for scoring and similarity.
Logic Programming (Formal Rule Representation & Evaluation)
Python alone isn’t ideal for defining and reasoning about complex rules. A logic language (embedded or standalone) is recommended:

Option 1: Prolog (Logic-Driven Rule Evaluation)
Why? Prolog’s declarative nature is excellent for defining and evaluating sequence constraints.
Use Case: Express rules declaratively and efficiently check sequence validity.
Tooling:
SWI-Prolog (Standalone) – Mature, open-source Prolog with Python bindings (pyswip).
PyDatalog (Embedded in Python) – Datalog subset, easier integration with Python.
Option 2: Lean / Coq (Formal Verification)
Why? If you need mechanical proofs of rule correctness, use:
Lean – More modern, supports dependent types and automation.
Coq – More mature, used for verifying compilers and DSL correctness.
Use Case: Verifying that your parsing, equivalence, and evaluation algorithms are mathematically sound.
